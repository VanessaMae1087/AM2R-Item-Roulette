This AM2R mod takes the term randomizer... maybe a little too literally.
All items rapidly shuffle between eachother, from Missiles, Power Bombs, Screw Attack, you name it. This has some softlock potential, but thats just how the gamble is. Will you get lucky?

All Expansion items have increased totals to make things a bit less tedious. Missiles give 10, Supers and Power Bombs give 5. With these values halfed on Hard and Fusion.
